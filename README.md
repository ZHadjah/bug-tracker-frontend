#bug-tracker-frontend

This project is the client side portion of my bug tracking application (click this link to view the backend: https://github.com/ZHadjah/BugTracker_Backend). The Bug Tracker is a multi tenant bug tracking application that will allow developers to keep track of issues that arise on their projects.

The client side is written in React and utilizes Antd for the design and Redux for authentication.
